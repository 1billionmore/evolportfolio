Hi and welcome. 

Please look at inequality for a basic Individual class. 
Robot.py is an extension of that, and then there are types of Robots, PlayerRobot, NeuralRobot and RandomRobot. 

We are going to test how these things learn the game of TicTacToe using an evolutionary algorithm in TicTacToe.py and in inequality.py. Inequality.py is where most of the methods are. Tic Tac Toe are rules of Tic Tac Toe and some of the execution of the methods from inequality.py.
